# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to pick a dataset from AWS and to use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, and connect to an AWS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. After this, we'll use PySpark to determine if there's any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset
